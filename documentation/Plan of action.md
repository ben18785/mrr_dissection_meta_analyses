## Essential

* Write up method and data description for parity analysis
* Gonotrophic cycle estimates by genus (perhaps even revisit this approach as not convinced it's ideal)
* Scrutinise species classifications:
  * MRR
  * Dissection
  * Parity (done)
* Estimate individual lifespans for parity
* Dissection power analysis SOM (I think I just wanted to look at senescence here?)
* Look at Github issues
* Table of references for included studies (or does this exist in the Excel files?)
* Quantify difference in lifespan from dissection vs parity
  * Can do a power analysis too
* Posterior predictive checks for parity analysis

## Nice to have

* Make overall estimates where we combine all three data sources
* Group-level estimates of lifespan? Based on scrutinising the species classifications
* Identify which species are where:
  * MRR
  * Dissection
* Plot individual estimates of lifespan on a map:
  * MRR
  * Dissection
  * Parity
* Do model fitting for MRR:
  * Male / female vs no differences (have I done this before?)
  * Pre-feeding
  * Temperature
